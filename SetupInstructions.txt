PREREQUISITES:
	HAZUS version 4.2.3 or newer installed.
		This version of HAZUS also requires ArcGIS version 10.5.
		Below is a list of tables utilized in these scripts:
			CDMS install is required as well
				[CDMS]..[CaltransMasterList_2019]
				[CDMS]..[cdms_AEBMParameters]
				[CDMS]..[cdms_CensusUrbanAreas]
				[CDMS]..[cdms_syCounty]
				[CDMS]..[eqEFBldgTypeDefault]
				[CDMS]..[GeneralBuildingEarthquakeBuilding]
				[CDMS]..[HwyCalTransCost] 
				[CDMS]..[HwyOwnerTable]
				[CDMS]..[hzPctContentOfStructureValue]
				[CDMS]..[hzReplacementCost]
				[CDMS]..[hzSqftFactors]
				[CDMS]..[StateRSMeans]
			Hazus_model install is required as well
				[Hazus_model]..[fl*Dflt]
					* = Essential Facility
			State database tables
				['state']..[eq*]
				['state']..[fl*]
				['state']..[flSchemeMapping]
				['state']..[hifld_*] (these are created by the Python scripts)
				['state']..[hz*]
				['state']..[hzDemographicsT] 
				['state']..[hzMeansCountyLocationFactor]
				['state']..[hzTract]
					* = Essential Facility, Transportation, Utility
			Other
				sys.indexes
				sys.objects
	Python version 2.7 installed as part of the HAZUS/ArcGIS install.
		Will need to install PYODBC, ideally with PIP.
	SQL Server.
		1) Attach the 'Hazus_model_data.mdf' database from 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Hazus-MH\Data\Aggregation'
		If using HAZUS version prior to 4.2.3, then follow steps 2 and 3:
		2) Add cdms.dbo.eqEFBldgTypeDefault. Right click database (CDMS) and select TASK > Import Data. Flat file 
			source.	SQL Server Native Client 11.0. Use SQL Server Auth; hazuspuser; CDMS database.
		3) Add CensusUrbanAreas to SQL Server under CDMS. You can use ESRI ArcMap to import the data using the 
			Feature Class to Feature Class tool. Name it "cdms_CensusUrbanArea" or rename it to this if its 
			in all caps. This dataset must be in WGS84 GCS.
		If using HAZUS version prior to TBD, then follow steps 4-7:
		4) Add csv as "cdms.dbo.HwyOwnerTable"
		5) Add csv as "cdms.dbo.HwyCalTransCost"
		6) Add csv as "cdms.dbo.StateRsMeans"
		7) Add csv as "cdms.dbo.CaltransMasterList_2019"

STEPS:	
	1) Copy the .py, .ini files to the same folder.
	2) Update the ServerName, UserName and Password in the .ini file with your credentials for SQL Server.
	3) Run the .py script. If any errors occur, see the HELP section.
	3a) HighwayBridges csv file should be downloaded and the script updated to point to it prior to running. See warning 2.
	4) To be able to aggregate new Study Regions in Hazus do the following:
	4a) Detach the 'Hazus_model' database 
	4b) Right-click on 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Hazus-MH\Data\Aggregation\Hazus_model_data.mdf' 
	4c) Select the Security tab 
	4d) Add Everyone 
	4e) Grant Full Permissions 
	4f) Click OK

	
WARNINGS:
	1) When running any script that uses Arcpy module you will need to attach AS,IN,OR databases with a underscore prefix "_" 
		as in _AS,_IN,_OR to avoid reserved SQL and having the script fail. You will also need to revert the change 
		to run on non-arcpy scripts. If you are not running AS,IN,OR you will not need to make the change.
	2) Highwaybridges (National_Bridge_Inventory_NBI_Bridges.csv) may not download in a reasonable time and the script may fail. A 	
		workaround is to download the csv and set the variable "tempCSVPath" to the path of the downloaded csv file.
